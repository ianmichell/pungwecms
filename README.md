# Pungwe CMS

The current state of popular open source java cms is pretty dire... The most popular being 
licensed under both commercial and proprietry licenses; such as magnolia.

I wanted to create a CMS that I can use as a base for other projects and given recent experience 
with drupal, there is a lot to like about it. You can build complete and functional websites very 
rapidly with less of a learning curve and half the hassle (once you know what you're doing).

Pungwe CMS is heavily influenced by drupal 7 and 8. I want to build something that takes the best
of what drupal has to offer and provide something similar based on java. This doesn't mean that it's
a Drupal clone... This just means it's similar and heavily based on my point of view (which means 
lost of type safety, spring oriented design and of course denormalised data, without JCR).

##Â Things to do

- Should probably start populating the wiki with documentation
- Design how Rest API will work with everything (pretty much, should run headless if need be)
- Rest API should override views, so that developers can use pure client side apps
- Get swagger on the go for rest api documentation
- Need to finish designing how themes and templates will work
- Look into app packaging, so that desktop class apps can be built and run locally
- Change / revision system for entities
