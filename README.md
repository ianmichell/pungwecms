# Pungwe CMS

## Introduction

The current state of popular open source java cms is pretty dire... The most popular being 
licensed under both commercial and proprietry licenses; such as magnolia.

I wanted to create a CMS that I can use as a base for other projects and given recent experience 
with drupal, there is a lot to like about it. You can build complete and functional websites very 
rapidly with less of a learning curve and half the hassle (once you know what you're doing).

Pungwe CMS is heavily influenced by drupal 7 and 8. I want to build something that takes the best
of what drupal has to offer and provide something similar based on java. This doesn't mean that it's
a Drupal clone... This just means it's similar and heavily based on my point of view (which means 
lost of type safety, spring oriented design and of course denormalised data, without JCR).

More to come...
